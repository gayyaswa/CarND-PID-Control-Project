# Overview

The objective of this project is to let the vehicle complete the track by tuning the paramteres Proportional(P), Differential(D) and Integral(I) as mentioned in the class lessions. The simulator provides Cross Track Error(CTE) which is used to tune in the proportional, differential and integral errors and update the steer value accordingly. I choose to tune the paramaters manually without using any algorithms such as gradient descent and managed to make the vehicle complete the track successfuly

# Rubic Points

Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.
